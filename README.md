# Requeriments
The `client` needs a platform to manage the basic bank activities.
So, as a bank, we have offices in different cities and we are
constantly moving out.

We provide the possibility to our potential and current clients,
to have one or more accounts in our bank. They can transfer money
between their accounts and to other people too. But, if for any
reason the client can't pay, we will freeze his account so he will
not be able neither to receive or give money. For us, it is the worst
people who is in debt so, no one can have negative numbers in his account.

## CASE USES
- The bank can create accounts for the clients
- The bank can have different offices
- The bank can freeze accounts if there is not enough money
- The user can have more than one account
- The user can transfer money to himself or other people
- The user can't transfer money if his account is frozen
